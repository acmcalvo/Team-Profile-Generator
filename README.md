  ## Description
  
   We are build a functional application for building Node.js applications. Before creating and running the test, build the code so that we can make sure that our logic is working properly, And then we create a library containing each class or category and basic information to meet the minimum challenge requirements, and create an index.js file that contains all the inputs generated on the htmlRenderer (HTML) output.
